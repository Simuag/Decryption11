The provided C++ program can be used to decrypt a ciphertext when you have a known word or phrase (the "crib") as a hint. Here's how it might be used:

1. **Input Preparation**: You have a ciphertext that you suspect contains some hidden message or information, but it's encrypted or encoded in some way. You also have a "crib," which is a word or phrase that you suspect might appear in the decrypted message.

2. **Compile and Run**: Compile the C++ program, and then run it. The program will prompt you to provide the ciphertext and the crib as inputs.

3. **Provide Inputs**: Enter the ciphertext and crib when prompted by the program. The ciphertext should be the encrypted message, and the crib should be a word or phrase that you believe is part of the message. The program will then attempt to decrypt the message using the provided crib.

4. **Decryption Attempt**: The program will process the ciphertext and the crib. It will try to find matches between words in the crib and words in the ciphertext, and it will build a mapping of letters for decryption. For example, if the program finds that 'c' in the crib corresponds to 'h' in the ciphertext, it will use that mapping.

5. **Decryption Output**: If the program successfully decrypts the message (i.e., it finds a valid mapping), it will print the decrypted message to the console. The decrypted message will be the original message with the substitutions made based on the mappings found during the decryption attempt.

6. **Evaluation**: Review the decrypted message to determine if it makes sense or contains the information you were looking for. If the decryption is successful, you've uncovered the hidden message. If not, you can try different cribs or other decryption methods.

7. **Iterate**: If you suspect that there might be multiple layers of encryption or if the initial crib didn't yield useful results, you can repeat the process with different cribs or modify the code to handle more complex decryption methods.

This program can be helpful in situations where you have a ciphertext and a reasonable guess (the crib) about what part of the message might be. It's not a guaranteed method for all encryption schemes, and its effectiveness depends on the complexity of the encryption and the quality of the crib. Additionally, it assumes a simple letter-to-letter substitution, which may not be suitable for all encryption methods.
